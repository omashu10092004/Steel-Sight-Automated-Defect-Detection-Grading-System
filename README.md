# Steel-Sight-Automated-Defect-Detection-Grading-System

Steel Sight is an advanced computer vision system designed to automatically detect defects in steel sheet images, calculate the area affected by defects, and assign quality grades accordingly. This project leverages deep learning and image processing techniques to bring automation, accuracy, and consistency to quality control in steel manufacturing and inspection processes.


🎯 Key Features
✅ Automated Defect Detection
Detects surface defects in steel sheets using advanced image processing and deep learning models.

📐 Defect Area Calculation
Precisely measures the percentage of the surface area affected by defects.

🏷️ Quality Grading System
Grades steel sheets based on the severity and area of the detected defects (e.g., Grade A, B, C).

📊 Visual Marking & Reporting
Provides output images with defect regions highlighted and a summary report of defect statistics.

⚙️ Customizable Thresholds
Allows tuning of defect severity and grading thresholds to adapt to various industrial standards.
